*** Steps to accept TCP/IP Network Connection 

# 1. socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 3
- af_inet=internet socket
- sock_stream=tcp/ip
- use the IP protocol
- the socket gets updated in the FD table as file descriptor 3

# 2. bind(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(80), sin_address=inet_addr("0.0.0.0")}, 16) = 0
- bind to socket, fd3
- binding to internet socket type
- connecting to port 80
- addresses that can connect are the whole entire internet
- padding of socket is 16

# listen (3, 0) = 0
- start acepting connection from object matching fd3 with  any ip address

# accept(3, NULL, NULL) = 4
- accept all connection requests matching the above 
- as soon as the connection is accepted, an immediate result is returned on FD4 which is created 
- and  represents a whole brand new socket with two ends communicating through the socket 
- straight over the internet
