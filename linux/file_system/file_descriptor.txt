# File Desriptor:
# A file descriptor is simply an integer associated with an open file. But (and here’s the catch), 
# that file can be a network connection, a FIFO, a pipe, a terminal, 
# a real on-the-disk file, or just about anything else. 
# Everything in Unix is a file! So when you want to communicate with 
# another program over the Internet you’re gonna do it through a file descriptor, 
# you’d better believe it.
