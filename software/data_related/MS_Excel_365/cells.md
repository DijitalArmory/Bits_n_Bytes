# Excel Cells
Cells in Excel are the basic units of a worksheet and are used to store and organize data. They are identified by their unique cell references, which are typically denoted by a letter and number combination that represents the column and row of the cell.

Each cell can contain different types of data, including text, numbers, dates, and formulas. Text data is typically used for labels, titles, and headings, while numerical data is used for calculations and analysis. Dates can be used to track events and deadlines, while formulas are used to perform complex calculations and automate tasks.

Cells can also be formatted to change their appearance, such as font size, color, or alignment. They can also be merged, split, or resized to fit different types of data.

Cells are the foundation of Excel and are used to create spreadsheets that can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as budgeting, data analysis, and project management.
