# Excel Custom Lists
Custom lists in Excel allow you to define your own sequence of values that can be easily entered or sorted in a specific order. This is especially helpful when you frequently need to enter or arrange data in a specific sequence that is not included in Excel's default list of options.

Excel provides several predefined custom lists, such as days of the week and months of the year. However, you can also create your own custom lists to suit your specific needs.

To define a custom list in Excel, follow these steps:

* Open Excel and go to the __"File"__ menu.
* Click on __"Options"__ (or "Excel Options" depending on your Excel version).
* In the __"Options"__ dialog box, select the __"Advanced"__ tab.
Scroll down to the __"General"__ section and click on __"Edit Custom Lists"__.

In the __"Custom Lists"__ dialog box, you can either type your list directly in the __"List entries"__ box, with each entry on a new line, or you can import the list from a range in your worksheet by clicking the __"Import"__ button and selecting the range.
Once you have entered or imported your custom list, click "Add" to add it to the custom lists in Excel.
Click "OK" to save the custom list and close the dialog box.
After defining a custom list, you can use it in various Excel features, including:

AutoFill: When you start typing a value from the custom list, Excel will suggest and automatically fill in the remaining values in the sequence.
Sorting: When you sort a column containing values from a custom list, Excel will sort them in the order specified in the custom list.
Data Validation: You can use a custom list to define a dropdown menu in a cell or range, allowing users to select values from the predefined sequence.
Chart Axis Labels: Custom lists can also be used to specify the labels for chart axes.
By creating and using custom lists, you can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of data entry and sorting in Excel, especially when working with specific sequences or sets of values that are frequently used in your worksheets.
