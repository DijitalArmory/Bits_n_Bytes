# Excel Formulas

In Excel, a formula is an equation that performs a calculation on one or more values or cell references. Formulas are used to automate calculations and to analyze and manipulate data in a worksheet.

A formula in Excel always begins with an equal sign (=) and can include a combination of operators, cell references, functions, and constants. Operators include the plus sign (+) for addition, the minus sign (-) for subtraction, the asterisk (*) for multiplication, the forward slash (/) for division, and the caret (^) for exponentiation.

For example, the following formula multiplies the value in cell A1 by the value in cell B1 and then adds the value in cell C1:

`=A1*B1+C1`

In addition to operators, Excel includes a wide range of built-in functions that can be used in formulas to perform more complex calculations. Functions include the SUM function for adding a range of values, the AVERAGE function for finding the average of a range of values, and the IF function for testing a condition and returning a value based on the result.

For example, the following formula uses the SUM function to add the values in cells A1 through A5:

`=SUM(A1:A5)`

Formulas can be entered directly into the cells of a worksheet, or they can be entered into the formula bar at the top of the Excel window. Once a formula is entered, Excel automatically calculates the result and displays it in the cell.

Excel also includes a range of tools for working with formulas, including the ability to copy and paste formulas, use relative and absolute references, and create named ranges. Formulas are a powerful tool for working with data in Excel, and can help to streamline workflows and automate calculations.

## Copying Formulas

You can copy formulas by selecting a cell with a given formula applied and dragging (by the corner) along a cell range
that you want to fill with that given formula.
* Fill the empty cells (and the cell(s) with the applied formula) and type `CTRL+D`
