# The Average Function

The AVERAGE function in Excel is a mathematical function that calculates the arithmetic mean of a range of cells that contain numeric values. The syntax of the AVERAGE function is:

`=AVERAGE(value1, [value2], â€¦)`

Here, value1 is the first argument or range of cells that you want to average, and value2 is the second argument or range of cells that you want to average. You can include up to 255 value arguments in the AVERAGE function.

For example, if you want to find the average of the values in the range A1:A10, you can use the following formula:

`=AVERAGE(A1:A10)`

This will return the average of all the numeric values in the range A1:A10. If the range contains the values 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25, the formula will return 15, which is the average of those values.

The AVERAGE function is a very useful tool when working with data in Excel, as it allows you to quickly and easily calculate the average of a range of values. It can be used to calculate the average of a single column or row, or it can be used to calculate the average of multiple ranges of cells.

Note that the AVERAGE function only considers cells that contain numeric values. It ignores empty cells, text, and logical values (TRUE or FALSE). If a range of cells contains both numeric and non-numeric values, the AVERAGE function will return an error value.
