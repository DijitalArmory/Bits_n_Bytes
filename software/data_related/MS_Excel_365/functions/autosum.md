# Autosum Function
---

__The Autosum function in Excel is a built-in feature that allows you to quickly and easily add up a range of cells in a spreadsheet. It automatically identifies the range of cells that contain numerical__ __data above the currently selected cell, and then adds them up and displays the result in the selected cell.__

__To use the Autosum function in Excel, you can simply select the cell where you want to display the sum, and then click on the Autosum button (represented by the Greek letter sigma) in the Home tab of__ __the ribbon. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut key Alt + = to quickly insert the Autosum formula. Excel will then automatically select the range of cells it thinks you want to sum, but you can__ __adjust the range manually if needed.__

__The Autosum function can save you a lot of time and effort when working with large sets of data, and it can help to ensure that your calculations are accurate and consistent.__
__It can calculate the...__

* `=Max(c:c, [c:c])` (_gives the highest/max number_)
* `Min(c:c, [c:c])` (_gives the lowest/min number_)
